An online voting system can be developed using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end of the website. The front end is responsible for user interaction, such as displaying the voting interface, handling user input, and updating the UI in real-time.
How it can work:
User Interface: HTML5 and CSS are used to create a user-friendly interface where voters can select their choices.
JavaScript: JavaScript is used to handle user interactions, such as clicking on a candidate's name or submitting a vote. It can also be used to validate user input and update the UI in real-time.
Vote Submission: When a user submits their vote, JavaScript can send an HTTP request to the server to record the vote
